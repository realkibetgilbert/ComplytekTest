##  Getting Started with Docker

###  Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/realkibetgilbert/ComplytekTest.git
cd ComplytekTest.API
```

###  Step 2: Run with Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This will:

- Build the API image  
- Start API and SQL Server containers  
- Wait for SQL Server to be ready  
- Apply EF Core migrations  
- Seed initial data  

###  Step 3: Access the API

- Swagger UI: [http://localhost:5192](http://localhost:5192)

---

##  API Versioning

This API uses **URL segment-based versioning**.

- All endpoints are prefixed with the version number.  
- Current version: `v1`

###  Example

To access employee endpoints:

```
GET http://localhost:5192/api/v1/employee
```

Ensure all requests are made using the `/api/v1/` prefix.

##  Local Development

###  Step 1: Update Connection String

Update the connection string in:

```bash
ComplytekTest.API/appsettings.json
```

###  Step 2: Apply EF Core Migrations

```bash
dotnet ef database update
```

###  Step 3: Run the API Locally

```bash
dotnet run --project ComplytekTest.API
```
